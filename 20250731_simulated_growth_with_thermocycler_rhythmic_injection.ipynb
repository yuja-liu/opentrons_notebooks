    "The thermocycler module has the convenient functionality of opening or closing the lid on command (by a chunk of code). With this we can only leave the tubes open to air when actively pipetting (on the scale of minutes) and closed for the rest of the time. This will significantly reduce evaporation compared to leaving the tubes open at all times without the help of any oil overlay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous experimental results (FP) suggest that proteins are damaged after 3 days of simulated growth with oil, but U-KaiC prepped worked fine. So likely oil is the problem here. With the thermocyler we can minimize evaporation without the help of oil which will likely improve the quality of the reaction. I will keep the samples in the thermocyler too so no need to add water back -- this will streamline the protocol and reduce the amount of plastic waste."
